## About Myself: ##
After graduating from secondary school in 2011, I entered Samara State Transport university. After completing a five-year degree programme, I successfully graduated with a degree in Transport engineering and with a  graduate specialization in Railway power supply/Train Traffic Control Systems.
In 2016-2017 I served in the army.
In 2017, I got a job at the railway transport as an electromechanic of a test coach.
A year later, having improved my qualifications, I got a position as a leading engineer in the technical department. I acquired planning and forecasting skills, as well as leadership qualities and  stress tolerance. These qualities allowed me to become the head of the department after six months of work.
At the moment, I am working in  the innovation department, where I am organizing the implementation of startups on innovative solutions to problems existing in the railway transport. Having worked in this area, I have determined the main aim for myself - to improve my IT skills in order to fulfill myself as a successful person.
